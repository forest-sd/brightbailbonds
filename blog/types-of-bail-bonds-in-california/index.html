<h2>Types of Bail Bonds in California: What You Need to Know</h2>
<p><em>Published 2026-02-22</em></p>
<p>When a judge sets bail in a California criminal case, there are several ways the defendant can secure their release from custody. Each type of bail has different requirements, costs, and implications. Understanding your options helps you make the best decision for your specific situation and get your loved one home as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>Surety Bail Bonds</h3>
<p>Surety bonds are the most common type of bail bond used in California. This is what most people think of when they hear "bail bond." With a surety bond, you pay a premium — typically 10% of the total bail amount — to a licensed bail bond company. The company then posts a surety bond with the court guaranteeing the defendant's appearance at all court dates. If bail is set at $50,000, you'd pay a $5,000 premium to the bail bond company, rather than coming up with the full $50,000 in cash.</p>

<p>The premium is non-refundable — it's the cost of the service. However, this is often the most practical option for families who cannot afford to pay the full bail amount out of pocket. Companies like <a href="https://www.brightbailbonds.com/">Bright Bail Bonds</a> also offer flexible payment plans, making surety bonds accessible even when finances are tight.</p>

<h3>Cash Bail</h3>
<p>Cash bail means paying the full bail amount directly to the court or jail. If bail is $50,000, you'd need to provide $50,000 in cash (or sometimes cashier's check or money order). The advantage of cash bail is that the full amount is returned to you when the case is resolved, as long as the defendant appears at all court dates. The disadvantage is obvious — most people don't have tens of thousands of dollars readily available, and the money is tied up for the duration of the case, which can take months or even years.</p>

<p>Cash bail can make sense when bail amounts are relatively small — a few hundred or few thousand dollars — and the family has the funds available. For larger bail amounts, a surety bond is typically more practical.</p>

<h3>Property Bonds</h3>
<p>In some cases, California courts accept real property (real estate) as collateral for bail. The property must have equity equal to at least 150% of the bail amount, and the court places a lien on the property until the case is resolved. Property bonds are complex, requiring a property appraisal, title search, and court hearing — which means they take significantly longer to process than surety bonds or cash bail. They're generally only used when bail amounts are very high and other options aren't feasible.</p>

<h3>Own Recognizance (OR) Release</h3>
<p>In some cases, a judge may release a defendant on their own recognizance — meaning no bail payment is required. The defendant simply signs a written promise to appear at all court dates. OR release is typically granted for minor offenses when the defendant has strong community ties, no prior criminal history, and is not considered a flight risk or danger to the community. An attorney can petition the court for an OR release at a bail hearing.</p>

<h3>Citation Release</h3>
<p>For minor offenses, a citation release (also called "cite out") may be issued by the arresting officer at the scene. Instead of being taken to jail, the defendant receives a written citation with a court date and is released immediately. This is most common for minor traffic violations, petty theft, and other low-level misdemeanors. No bail bond is needed for a citation release.</p>

<h3>Federal Bail Bonds</h3>
<p>Federal cases operate under different rules than state cases. Federal bail bonds are typically more expensive (15% premium instead of 10%) and involve more stringent requirements. Federal judges have broad discretion in setting bail conditions, and the process generally takes longer. If you or a loved one is facing federal charges, it's important to work with a bail bond company that has federal bond experience.</p>

<h3>Which Option Is Right for You?</h3>
<p>For most families, a surety bail bond provides the best combination of speed, affordability, and accessibility. The 10% premium is a fraction of the total bail amount, payment plans make it manageable, and experienced bail agents handle all the paperwork and jail coordination.
