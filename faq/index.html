<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Clear answers to common questions about bail bonds and the release process.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How does the bail bond process work?</h3>
<p>When someone is arrested, a judge sets a bail amount based on the charges and other factors. A bail bond allows you to pay a percentage of the total bail amount (typically 10% in California) to a licensed bail agent, who then posts the full bail with the court. This secures the defendant's release from custody while their case is pending. The defendant must appear at all court dates, or the full bail amount becomes due.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How much does a bail bond cost?</h3>
<p>In California, bail bond premiums are regulated by the Department of Insurance at 10% of the total bail amount. For example, if bail is set at $50,000, the bail bond premium would be $5,000. This premium is non-refundable — it's the fee for the bail bond service. Bright Bail Bonds offers flexible payment plans to help make this cost manageable for your family.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long does it take to get someone out of jail?</h3>
<p>Release times vary depending on the jail facility and how busy they are at the time. In general, once the bail bond paperwork is completed and submitted, release can take anywhere from 2 to 12 hours. Some smaller facilities process releases faster, while larger county jails may take longer. Our agents work to expedite the process as much as possible and keep you informed every step of the way.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
<p>Yes. We understand that bail amounts can be significant and that many families need flexible payment options. Bright Bail Bonds offers customized payment plans based on your financial situation.

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What information do I need to bail someone out?</h3>
<p>To begin the bail bond process, we'll need: the full legal name of the person in custody, their date of birth, the jail or detention facility where they're being held, their booking number (if available), and the charges or bail amount (if known). Don't worry if you don't have all this information — our agents can help locate your loved one and gather the details needed to get started.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What happens if the defendant misses a court date?</h3>
<p>Missing a court date is serious. The judge will likely issue a bench warrant for the defendant's arrest, and the bail bond can be forfeited — meaning the full bail amount becomes due. If a court date is missed, contact us immediately. In some cases, we can help get the court date rescheduled before a warrant is issued. This is why Bright Bail Bonds provides court date reminders to all our clients.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can you help with any type of charge?</h3>
<p>Yes. Bright Bail Bonds handles bail for all types of criminal charges including misdemeanors, felonies, DUI/DWI, drug offenses, domestic violence, theft, assault, and more. Regardless of the charge, everyone deserves access to the bail process, and we treat every client with the same level of urgency, respect, and professionalism.</p>
